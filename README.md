Mini-Game Portal (project WINNING)
Team: The Boyz
Project Concept: We intend to utilize Hibernate, Angular, Maven and other learned tools to create a SPA featuring several JavaScript coded mini games. Our site will have a login feature and users will be able to view a leaderboard and their own high score while logging in.  We will present a list of games, at most 2 players, that the user can play. admin users will have full control of the leader boards and can update userâ€™s information/credentials.

Backend â€“ 
In this project Spring MVC and Hibernate were used. OrmConfiguration.java is used to set up the connection to our database, session factory, hibernate properties, and transaction functionality. The DAO design was used to separate the different layers of the project. The â€˜daoâ€™ package is used to make the dao interface and dao implementation to create all CRUD operations using Hibernate. The â€˜serviceâ€™ package is used to abstract the functionality from the dao from the presentation layer.The â€˜modelâ€™ package is used to store all the object classes used within the project. The â€˜controllerâ€™ layer is used to implement Spring MVC to map the service layer to HttpRequests. There is console logging functionality using log4j.
